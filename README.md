Morse Code

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences 
of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. 
Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, 
as follows: “a” maps to “.-“, “b” maps to “-…”, “c” maps to “-.-.”, and so on.

In this Java project we have developet a morse code translator. The program takes input
from the user what they want to translate english->morse or morse->english.

And then the user has to write a sentence or a morse code for the translation.

The program is developed by using hashmaps to store the characters as keys
and morse codes as values, and two methods to do the translations.
